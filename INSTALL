NAME
	INSTALL - How to install Algorithm::RandomMatrixGeneration

SYNOPSIS
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	make clean	

DESCRIPTION

   Prerequisites

	Perl Modules:
	------------
	Math::BigFloat


   Installing

	Method 1:
	--------
	The usual way to install the package is to run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	make clean

	Method 2
	--------
	If you are not a superuser or want to install the module locally then following installation procedure should 
        be used

	perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/anagha/lib
	make
	make test
	make install
	make clean

	In this case the module will be installed in /home/anagha/lib (provided you have read-write permissions to this directory) and 
	this path should be appended to PERL5LIB environment variable.

	Method 3
	--------
	Executing the following commands
	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/anagha/Algorithm-RandomMatrixGeneration
	make
	make test
	make install
	make clean

    will install the module in /home/anagha/Algorithm-RandomMatrixGeneration/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.5 (provided you have 
	read-write permissions to /home/anagha/Algorithm-RandomMatrixGeneration directory and you have Perl v5.8.5 or else the 
	last directory in the path will be your systems perl version). This path should be appended to PERL5LIB environment variable.
